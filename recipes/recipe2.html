    <p>A hearty dessert after a long day at work.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p>225g softened butter</p></li>
        <li><p>225g golden caster sugar</p></li>
        <li><p>4 large eggs</p></li>
        <li><p>Â½ lemon, zested</p></li>
        <li><p>1 tsp vanilla extract</p></li>
        <li><p>225g self-raising flour</p></li>
        <li><p>splash of milk</p></li>
        <li><p>Optional fillings of lemon curd, jam, lightly whipped cream</p></li>
        <li><p>icing sugar for dusting</p></li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4, butter and line the base of two 20cm spring-form cake tins with baking parchment.</p></li>
        <li><p>Using an electric whisk beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Crack the eggs in one at a time and whisk well, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the lemon zest, vanilla, flour, milk and a pinch of salt. Whisk until just combined then divide the mixture between the two tins.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. After 10 mins remove the cakes from their tins and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Fill how you like. My personal favourite is a good dollop of lemon curd and some fresh cream, then dust the top with icing sugar. Will keep for 3 days.</p></li>
